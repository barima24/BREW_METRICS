Coffee store sales Analysis

**Overview**
Welcome to the Coffee Store Sales Analysis Dashboard! This project aims to uncover insights into the sales performance of a coffee store across multiple locations. By leveraging Power BI for advanced visualizations and Microsoft Excel for initial data preprocessing, this dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales trends, profitability, and customer purchasing behavior.

**Objective**
The goal of this project was to transform raw sales data into actionable insights. By employing data transformation techniques in Excel and creating interactive visualizations in Power BI, this analysis helps stakeholders track performance metrics, identify trends, and forecast future sales effectively.

**Chapters**

1. **Data Preprocessing in Microsoft Excel**

1) Consolidated and cleaned raw data, ensuring it was structured and ready for analysis.
2) Created new columns, such as total sales and profit percentage per transaction, using Excel formulas (e.g., nested XLOOKUP).
3) Transformed scattered location-specific data into a unified table for better integration into Power BI.
4) Used Excel to derive essential metrics like sales per product category and profit margin by location.

2. **Dashboard Development in Power BI**

1) Built a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs).
2) Implemented a slicer to filter data by store location, allowing users to compare sales, profit, and transaction trends across stores.
3) Utilized DAX functions for time-based analysis, transforming transaction hour data into readable formats for peak hour identification.
4) Forecasted sales for the next 15 days using Power BI's built-in analytics tools.
5) Included a navigation button to switch between detailed forecast pages and the main dashboard.

3. **Visualizations and Key Features**

1) Category Performance by Sales: Highlighted revenue contributions from different product categories.
2) Profit Breakdown by Category: Showed profit percentage trends for various categories across locations.
3) Trending Products: Identified products with the highest sales growth.
4) Peak Hours and Busiest Days: Analyzed transaction data to determine customer footfall patterns by time and day.
5) Location-Based Sales & Profit Analysis: Compared sales and profit margins across store locations.
6) 15-Day Forecast: Predicted upcoming sales trends with interactive forecasting visuals.

**Key Insights**

1) Bakery and Coffee are the top-performing categories across all locations.
2) Peak transaction times occur between 10 AM and 12 PM, reflecting busy morning hours.
3) Lower Manhattan outperforms other locations in overall sales and profitability.
4) Sundays consistently record the highest transactions, making it the busiest day of the week.
5) The forecast shows a steady increase in sales, indicating strong customer demand.
   
This project highlights the importance of data-driven decisions for enhancing operational efficiency and understanding customer preferences. The use of Power BI and Excel demonstrates a seamless workflow from data preprocessing to insightful storytelling.
